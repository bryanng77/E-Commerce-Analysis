# ðŸ›’ Dunamis Ecommerce Analysis

## Project Background
Dunamis, a mid-sized e-commerce platform specializing in lifestyle and home goods, was making waves in the competitive online retail market. Known for its curated collection of stylish and affordable products, the company had built a loyal customer base and was steadily expanding its reach. With traffic pouring in from organic search, social media referrals, and email marketing campaigns, Dunamis seemed to be on track for an explosive growth.

Despite the increasing number of visitors to their site, conversion rates had hit a plateau. The leadership team noticed an unsettling trend: thousands of users browsed their site, added items to their carts, and then abandoned their purchases. Marketing campaigns designed to bring in new customers yielded diminishing returns, leaving the team questioning whether they were targeting the right audiences or wasting precious resources.

As the stakes grew higher, the leadership team in Dunamis faced critical questions:

+ Why were certain marketing campaigns falling flat?
+ Which customer segments were driving the most valueâ€”and which ones were disengaged?
+ How could they turn a flood of website traffic into meaningful sales?
+ 

The truth was that, Dunamis had mountains of data at their fingertips, but they lacked the ability to transform that data into actionable insights. Customer behavior across devices, channels, and regions remained a puzzle, and untapped opportunities were slipping through the cracks.
